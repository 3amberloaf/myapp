          <h2>Have You Overindulged?</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t worry, it happens sometimes. Unfortunately, one of the results of that overindulgence is the dreaded hangover. People vary in their susceptibility to hangovers, but for some people a single drink is all it takes to trigger a hangover. While others never seem to experience the nasty effects of a hangover no matter how much they drink!
          </p>
          <h2>Hangover Symptoms</h2>
          <p>A few of the more unpleasant symptoms of a hangover can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dehydration</li>
            <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
            <li>Headache and aching muscles</li>
            <li>Dizziness</li>
            <li>Weakness and shakiness</li>
            <li>Irritability</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Hangover IV Therapy Help</h2>
          <p>
            One of the main symptoms (and causes) of a hangover is dehydration. Alcohol suppresses the hormone known as vasopressin, which controls water loss in your body. The more alcohol you drink, the more you urinate, and the more dehydrated you become. According to Dr. Gary Murray from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, “Alcohol is a diuretic, so you end up losing water. And the dehydration effect is probably the most severe contributor to hangover.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The unpleasant symptoms of a hangover can last as long as 24 hours (though for others it can feel longer). That’s a long time to endure such misery!
